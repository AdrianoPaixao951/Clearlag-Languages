# Welcome to Clearlag's language file! Here you can modify the various strings ClearLag uses to suit your language, or preference
# -- NOTE: This is the format: '<key>({replaceables}...):<message>'
# -- NOTE: The replaceables are replaced depending on order, not the actual key name. So you may customize the key names too!
# -- NOTE: The { ... } symbols represent a message block. This is applicable anywhere you want... Do not include any characters with {, or }
